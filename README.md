Project One: Reimbursement Requests System

Expense Reimbursement Project -- All employees enter through a login page which switches landings depending on employee managment status. On the landing page employees get access to 5 cards, two of which are interactive and allow them to update their user information or to submit a new reimbursment request. Managers have the same landing page, but with added features including the 5 additional views to allow them to see all of the employees they manage, the company management scheme as a whole, as well as, allowing them to submit their own requests and approve or deny thier employee requests. Lastly, user's can logout of their respective landings and venture off into the merry land of work life.
